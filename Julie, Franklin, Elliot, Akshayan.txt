not erasing the whole word in wordle after putting in an invalid work does not work
golden letter does not line up with where it is suppose to be when typed in the wrong place
golden letter is always the first letter?
shuffle letters shuffles the golden letter too but does not actually change it resulting in different letters
dhalbat/dalbhat are considered invalid words making it impossible to progress.
Comments and Java docs are great.
Logic works for the most part, I would advise in the future to ensure that a valid word always works before doing your check in the dictionary that way it still works if it isn't in the dictionary.
